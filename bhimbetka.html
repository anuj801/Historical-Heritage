        <p>
            The Bhimbetka rock shelters are an archaeological site in central India that spans the Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods, as well as the historic period. It exhibits the earliest traces of human life in India and evidence of the Stone Age starting at the site in Acheulian times.

            According to archaeologists, it is the largest shelter at Bhimbetka and has a cathedral-like atmosphere with its gothic arches and spaces that soar. At the entrance of the cave, a large boulder known as King's Rock exists, which sits as the central feature of the Bhimbetka and other shelters spread. <br>
            The Bhimbetka rock shelters are an archaeological site in central India that spans the Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods, as well as the historic period.[1][2] It exhibits the earliest traces of human life in India and evidence of the Stone Age starting at the site in Acheulian times.[3][4][5] It is located in the Raisen District in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, about 45 kilometres (28 mi) south-east of Bhopal. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that consists of seven hills and over 750 rock shelters distributed over 10 km (6.2 mi).[2][6] At least some of the shelters were inhabited more than 100,000 years ago.[2][7]

            The rock shelters and caves provide evidence of human settlement and the cultural evolution from hunter-gatherers to agriculture, and expressions of prehistoric spirituality.[8]
            
            Some of the Bhimbetka rock shelters feature prehistoric cave paintings and the earliest are dated to 10,000 BCE, corresponding to the Indian Mesolithic.[9][10][11][12][13][14] These cave paintings show themes such as animals, early evidence of dance and hunting from the Stone Age as well as of warriors on horseback from a later time (perhaps the Bronze Age).[15][16][17] The Bhimbetka site has the oldest-known rock art in India,[18] as well as is one of the largest prehistoric complexes.[8][19]
            
            Location
            
            Archaeological Survey of India monument number N-MP-225
            The Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka are 45 kilometers south-east of Bhopal and 9  km from Obedullaganj city in the Raisen District of Madhya Pradesh at the southern edge of the Vindhya Range. South of these rock shelters are successive ranges of the Satpura hills. It is inside the Ratapani Wildlife Sanctuary, embedded in sandstone rocks, in the foothills of the Vindhya Range.[8][20] The site consists of seven hills: Vinayaka, Bhonrawali, Bhimbetka, Lakha Juar (east and west), Jhondra and Muni Babaki Pahari.[1.<br>
        On a hill overlooking the plain and about 40 km from Bhopal, the site of Sanchi comprises a group of Buddhist
        monuments (monolithic pillars, palaces, temples and monasteries) all in different states of conservation most of
        which date back to the 2nd and 1st centuries B.C. It is the oldest Buddhist sanctuary in existence and was a
        major Buddhist centre in India until the 12th century A.D.
        Outstanding Universal Value <br>
        In contrast, later paintings from the Historic period onwards depict processions, scenes of warriors with swords, shields, and daggers and collective rituals. These paintings are characterized by a marked absence of animal figures, which are disproportionately drawn whenever they do appear. It has also been suggested that the motifs used in some of these later paintings reveal the religious influence of Hinduism or Buddhism.

        In some, there are clear depictions of gods such as Ganesha and Shiva, representations of the Mother Goddess and symbols such as the trishul and swastika.
        
        Archaeologists have been able to differentiate these paintings from the earlier, more faded paintings underneath through processes such as radiocarbon dating and other methods. By this time, humans were no longer living in caves as hunter-gatherers but were in the early stages of civilization and a sedentary life with domesticated animals. <br>

        <p>
            The name Bhimbetka comes from the words Bhima, the second Pandava brother in the Mahabharata, and Baithaka, which means "seat" or "lounge". According to local legend, Bhima rested here during his exile to interact with the villagers and worship Mata Vaishavi. There is also a temple dedicated to Mata Vaishavi at the site.

       <h3> 1. History of Bhimbetka   </h3>
      <p>  Madhya Pradesh
        The Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka are in the foothills of the Vindhyan Mountains on the southern edge of the central Indian plateau. Within massive sandstone outcrops, above comparatively dense forest, are five clusters of natural rock shelters, displaying paintings that appear to date from the Mesolithic Period right through to the historical period. The cultural traditions of the inhabitants of the twenty-one villages adjacent to the site bear a strong resemblance to those represented in the rock paintings.
        
        Bhimbetka reflects a long interaction between people and the landscape. It is closely associated with a hunting and gathering economy, as demonstrated in the rock art and in the relicts of this tradition in the local adivasi villages on the periphery of the site.
        
        The site complex was discovered by V. S. Wakankar in 1957. Almost 100 years earlier, in 1867, rock paintings had been discovered in Uttar Pradesh and the first scientific article on Indian rock paintings was published by J. Cockburn in 1883. Bhimbetka was first mentioned in 1888 as a Buddhist site, from information obtained from local adivasis. Two shelters were excavated in 1971 by Bajpai, Pandey and Gour.  </p>
       
       <h3> 2. Restoration and Preservation</h3>
     <p>The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), under the Ministry of Culture, is the premier organization for the archaeological research and protection of the cultural heritage of the nation. Maintenance of ancient monuments and archaeological sites and remains of national importance is the prime concern of the ASI.

        They have over 3693 monuments under their supervision and have been actively looking for solutions to digitize and archive these historical monuments.
        
        One of the sites chosen for the initial Pilot was Bhimbhetka Rock shelters an archaeological site in central India that spans the Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods, as well as the historic period. It exhibits the earliest traces of human life in India and evidence of the Stone Age starting at the site in Acheulian times.

        <h3>3. Important Structures at Bhimbetka</h3>
     
     
     <p>   More than 750 sandstone rock shelters have earned Bhimbetka the prestigious UNESCO World Heritage Site status. Not because of the legend, but because this site is an archaeological site dating back to the Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods. Studies have shown some of the earliest traces of human life, right from the Stone Age.
        These rock shelters have the oldest rock paintings or petroglyphs in the world, some dating back to 10,000 years ago! One of the largest prehistoric complexes in the world, Bhimbetka, is home to prehistoric caves paintings and most interestingly, fossils from the Precambrian period.
     </p>
        
       <h3> 4. Cultural and Artistic Legacy</h3>
         <p>Bhimbetka's prehistoric cave paintings, dating to 10,000 BCE, depict animals, early Stone Age activities, and later scenes like warriors on horseback, possibly from the Bronze Age. It holds India's oldest-known rock art and is among the largest prehistoric complexes.
        
        Narrative Art: The carvings are a form of narrative art, depicting not only religious themes but also aspects of everyday life during ancient times. The art at Bhimbetka influenced the subsequent development of Indian sculpture and architecture.  </p>
