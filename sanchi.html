        <p>
          Sanchi Stupa stands as one of the oldest stone structures in India. It was commissioned by Emperor Ashoka after his conversion to Buddhism. The stupa, which means "heap," represents the burial mound of the Buddha and serves as a pilgrimage site for followers of Buddhism.

        <h2>Architectural Highlights</h2>
        <p>
          Sanchi is a religious and archaeological site in Madhya Pradesh, India that is home to a group of Buddhist
        monuments, including stupas, pillars, palaces, temples, and monasteries:Sanchi is the oldest Buddhist sanctuary in the world and was a major center of Buddhism from the 3rd century BC
        to the 12th century AD. The site's history includes: <br>
        Construction: The Great Stupa, or Stupa No. 1, was built during the Mauryan Empire and decorated with one of
        Ashoka's Pillars. Smaller stupas, such as Stupa No.  2 and Stupa No. 3, were built later.
        Discovery: General Taylor discovered the site in 1818 after it had been abandoned for 600 years. <br>
        Restoration: Major restoration work was carried out in 1912 by archaeologist John Marshall and Buddhist scholar
        Albert Foucher.<br>
        On a hill overlooking the plain and about 40 km from Bhopal, the site of Sanchi comprises a group of Buddhist
        monuments (monolithic pillars, palaces, temples and monasteries) all in different states of conservation most of
        which date back to the 2nd and 1st centuries B.C. It is the oldest Buddhist sanctuary in existence and was a
        major Buddhist centre in India until the 12th century A.D.
        Outstanding Universal Value <br>

        The stupas, temples, viharas, and stambha at Sanchi in central India are among the oldest and most mature
        examples of aniconic arts and free-standing architecture that comprehensively document the history of Buddhism
        from the 3rd century BCE to the 12th century CE. About 10 km from Vidisha, the Buddhist monuments at Sanchi,
        located on a serene and picturesque forested plateau, are also considered to be the sacrosanct Cetiyagiri in the
        Sri Lankan Buddhist chronicles, where Mahindra, the son of Emperor Aśoka, stopped prior to undertaking his
        journey as a missionary to Sri Lanka. The enshrined remains of Sariputra and Maudgalyayana (chief disciples of
        Buddha) in Sanchi were venerated by Theravadins, and continue to be revered to the present day. <br>

        The inception of Sanchi as a sacred centre is attributed to the Mauryan emperor Aśoka. His reign in the 3rd
        century BCE is considered instrumental to the spread of Buddhism throughout the Indian subcontinent. With the
        establishment of the monolithic Aśoka Stambha (pillar) bearing a highly elaborate capital, Emperor Aśoka
        distinguished Sanchi as a site of great importance. Contemporary with the stambha was a brick stupa, which was
        later increased in scale during the Sunga dynasty (184-72 BCE), covered with an ashlar stone veneer, and
        augmented with circumambulatory paths and staircases with ornate balustrades, harmika, yashti, chhatra, and four
        torana, which were later ornamented during the Satavahanas dynasty in the 1st century CE.<br>
         The last addition to
        the grand stupa was during the Gupta dynasty (5th century CE), when four shrines were added at the cardinal
        entry points. Today, this grand structure of Sanchi (“Stupa 1”) is considered an incomparable example of the
        mature phase of Indian stupas. Since Aśokan times, subsequent powerful empires that reigned over this region -
        such as the Sunga, Kushana, Kshatrapa, and finally Gupta dynasties - continued to contribute to the expansion of
        Sanchi with the construction of hypostyle, apsidal, and other temples and shrines, comparatively smaller stupas
        (Stupas 2 and 3), and numerous viharas. Corroborated by inscriptions present in the property, Sanchi remained an
        important seat of Buddhism until the 13th century CE. <br>

        The Buddhist monuments at Sanchi contain an appreciable concentration of early Indian artistic techniques and
        Buddhist art, referred to as its Anionic School or Phase. Depicting Buddha through symbols, the sculpted art
        shows the evolution in sculpting techniques and the elaboration of icons, especially depicting Buddha. Stories
        and facts of great religious and historical significance, enlivened with bas-relief and high-relief techniques,
        are also depicted. The quality of craftsmanship in representing the gamut of symbolism through plants, animals,
        human beings, and Jataka stories shows the development of art though the integration of indigenous and
        non-indigenous sculpting traditions.<br>

        Criterion (i): The perfection of its proportions and the richness of the sculpted decorative work on its four
        gateways make Stupa 1 an incomparable artistic achievement. The group of Buddhist monuments at Sanchi – stupas,
        temples and monasteries – is unique in India because of its age and quality.<br>

        Criterion (ii): From the time that the oldest preserved monument on the site was erected, i.e., Aśoka’s column
        with its projecting capital of lions inspired by Achaemenid art, Sanchi’s role as intermediary for the spread of
        cultures and their peripheral arts throughout the Mauryan Empire, and later in India of the Sunga, Shatavahana,
        Kushan and Gupta dynasties, was confirmed.<br>

        Criterion (iii): Having remained a principal centre of Buddhism up to early medieval India following the spread
        of Hinduism, Sanchi bears unique witness as a major Buddhist sanctuary in the period from the 3rd century BCE to
        the 1st century CE. <br>

        Criterion (iv): The stupas at Sanchi, in particular Stupa 1 and Stupa 3, represent the most accomplished form of
        this type of monument. The hemispherical, egg-shaped dome (anda), topped with a cubical relic chamber (harmika),
        is built on a circular terrace (medhi); it has one or two ambulatories for the faithful to use (pradakshina
        patha). Representing a transition from wood structures to stone, the railings (vedika) and the gateways (torana)
        also bear witness to the continued use of the primitive forms of megalithic tumuli covered with an outer layer
        and surrounded by a palisade. <br>

        Criterion (v): Sanchi is one of the oldest extant Buddhist sanctuaries. Although Buddha never visited the site
        during any of his former lives or during his earthly existence, the religious nature of this shrine is obvious.
        The chamber of relics of Stupa 3 contained the remains of Sariputra, a disciple of Shakyamuni who died six
        months before his master; he is especially venerated by the occupants of the “small vehicle” or Hinayana.<br>

        Integrity <br>

        Within the boundaries of the property are all the known elements necessary to express its Outstanding Universal
        Value, including the sculpted monolithic pillars, sanctuaries, temples, and viharas atop and along the slopes of
        the hillock of Sanchi. These elements demonstrate the complete vocabulary of mature Buddhist aniconic art and
        free-standing architecture. The property, which also encompasses its near natural setting, is thus of adequate
        size to ensure the complete representation of the features and processes that convey the significance of the
        Buddhist Monuments at Sanchi. The property is in a good state of conservation. Threats and potential threats to
        the integrity of the property include pressure from the local villagers to use the right-of-way in the
        prohibited area (as was the case in the historic past), incursions into this area, and development in the
        villages. <br>

        Authenticity  <br>

        The archaeological remains of the Buddhist Monuments at Sanchi are authentic in terms of their locations and
        setting, forms and design, and materials and substance, as well as, to a degree, their spirit. These
        representations of mature Buddhist free-standing architecture and aniconic sculpted art remain at their original
        locations and in a setting that is sympathetic. The Sanchi stupas (numbered 1, 2, and 3) were restored in the
        early 20th century and demonstrate all the original features characteristic of mature Indian stupas. Though
        abandoned for about 600 years, Sanchi has witnessed the revival of a pilgrimage from all over the Buddhist
        world, and in particular from Sri Lanka, thus testifying to the religious significance of this place. The site
        is alive with chants and prayers to immortalize the remains of Sariputra and Maudgalyayana, two of the foremost
        disciples of Lord Buddha.  <br>Sanchi is a religious and archaeological site in Madhya Pradesh, India that is home to a group of Buddhist

       <h3> 1. History of Sanchi   </h3>
      <p>  The history of Sanchi dates back to the 3rd century BCE, when the Great Stupa was commissioned by Emperor Ashoka, a significant figure in Indian history who embraced Buddhism after the Kalinga War. After adopting the teachings of Buddha, Ashoka built several stupas to spread the message of Buddhism. The Great Stupa at Sanchi was originally a simple hemispherical structure containing the relics of the Buddha.
        
        Commissioning by Ashoka: Emperor Ashoka, who ruled over a vast empire, erected the Great Stupa at Sanchi to honor the Buddha and mark the spread of Buddhism.
        Subsequent Expansions: In the 1st century BCE, during the reign of the Shunga dynasty, the stupa was expanded with more detailed ornamentation, including the addition of the stone railings and the four elaborately carved gateways (Toranas).   </p>
       <h3> 2. Architectural Significance</h3>
       <p> Sanchi’s architecture is a blend of simplicity, symbolism, and artistry. It reflects the development of Buddhist art and architecture over several centuries. The complex comprises stupas, temples, monasteries, and Ashokan pillars.
        
        The Great Stupa: The hemispherical mound of the stupa represents the burial mound of the Buddha and is a symbol of enlightenment. The structure itself stands on a raised terrace, with a harmika on top, representing the bodhi tree under which Buddha attained enlightenment. The chatra (umbrella-like structure) above symbolizes the protection of the Buddha's relics.
        
        The Four Gateways (Toranas): These four gates, facing the cardinal directions, are intricately carved with images from the Jataka Tales, which narrate stories from the Buddha's previous lives. The reliefs on the toranas are considered masterpieces of ancient Indian art, depicting events from the life of Buddha, like his birth, renunciation, enlightenment, and first sermon.
        
        Ashoka Pillar: One of the major features of the Sanchi complex is the Ashokan Pillar, which carries inscriptions and is adorned with carvings. This pillar once had the four-lion capital, which was later adapted as the national emblem of India. The Ashoka Pillar at Sanchi is also known for its polished stone surface and its beautiful lotus-shaped capital.   </p>
        
       <h3> 3. Religious Significance</h3>
         <p> Sanchi is one of the most significant religious centers for Buddhists. Though Buddha never visited the site personally, it became a major pilgrimage center after Ashoka’s adoption of Buddhism. The complex is a symbol of peace, non-violence, and the teachings of Buddha.
        
        Buddhist Pilgrimage Site: Sanchi has attracted Buddhist pilgrims from all over the world for centuries. It is one of the places where Buddhism flourished and spread to other parts of India and beyond.
        
        Spread of Buddhist Teachings: The stupa itself, along with the carvings and inscriptions, represents the propagation of the Buddha’s teachings on dharma, karma, and samsara (cycle of rebirth). The structures of Sanchi were designed to inspire meditation, introspection, and spiritual growth for the followers of Buddhism.
    </p> 
       <h3> 4. Restoration and Preservation</h3>
     <p>   Over the centuries, Sanchi fell into disrepair after the decline of Buddhism in India. However, during the 19th century, British archaeologists rediscovered Sanchi and began restoration efforts.
        
        Alexander Cunningham’s Role: In the 19th century, British archaeologist Alexander Cunningham led the efforts to restore the Great Stupa and other monuments at Sanchi. Thanks to these efforts, the site was preserved, and its significance re-established.
        
        UNESCO World Heritage Site: In 1989, the Sanchi Stupa and its surrounding monuments were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognizing its outstanding universal value as an ancient Buddhist center of art, culture, and architecture.   </p>
