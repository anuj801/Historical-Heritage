        <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
        <p>
            Capital of the Vijayanagara Empire
            Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire from 1336 to 1565, when it was the last great Hindu kingdom in South India. The city was a wealthy and prosperous center of trade and culture, and was considered one of the richest cities in the world at the time.

        <h2>Architectural Highlights</h2>
        <p>
            The Group of Monuments at Hampi, or Hampe, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in east-central Karnataka, India. Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 14 century. In 1336 AD, The two brothers Harihara and Bukka built the Vijayanagara Empire to protect Dharma and the spiritual guidance of Sage Vidyaranya. Hampi-Vijayanagara was the second-largest medieval-era city in the world after Beijing and is also considered India’s most prosperous city at the time, alluring merchants from Persia and Portugal. In 1565, the Muslim sultanates defeated the Vijayanagara Empire, causing Hampi to become a ruin. We will discuss the ruins of Hampi in India, information about Hampi and who built Hampi.
             <br>
        .There is information about Hampi. The Hampi in the ancient city of Karnataka is completely built of burnt bricks, and local granite from that also placed lime mortar. It is recognised that the architecture of Hampi is inspired by and is similar to the Indo Islamic Architecture. There were several distinguishing characteristics of Hampi’s architecture that set it apart from other ancient cities. Karnataka’s Hampi was an ancient and well-fortified city dating back thousands of years. And ruins of Hampi in India are famous worldwide. At Hampi, neither mortar nor cementing agents were found in the architecture or the walls. In Hampi, they constructed elaborate orchards and various pleasure gardens with sculptures and motifs, including the lotus and the corbels. Their purpose was to wedge them together through interlocking. The buildings in the royal complex had very grand arches, halls with huge columns and domes with niches for holding sculptures. It was a beautiful and prosperous city with several temples, farms and markets attracting traders from Portugal and Persia. The Vittala Temple Complex is a very well-known and famous temple at Hampi. Hampi was built in the 16th century, and the temple is dominated by 56 monolithic pillars, known as the Musical Pillars. The Virupaksha Temple, built in the 15th century at the western end of Hampi Bazaar, is the oldest in Hampi and has a 50-metre tall gopuram. <br>
        Tourism in Hampi
        Also, UNESCO recognised it as a world heritage site in 2008, and Hampi received much attention from foreign tourists. Also, it is not as famous as other archaeological sites in the country; the ruins of Hampi in India make it the biggest open-air archaeological museum globally. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is solely responsible for protecting and managing the site established in Hampi. The construction of a beautiful heritage authority, Hampi World Heritage Area Management Authority (HWHAMA), provides the product management and security of the site. It was seen to be of utmost preference to acknowledge the diversity and complex relationship among the cultural and economic systems in the region.

         Ruins of Hampi in India
         The Hampi empire reached its peak when the Delhi Sultanate defeated other kingdoms in the south.
         
         During the early 14th century, however, Muhammad bin Tughlaq rose to power in Delhi, changing the course of history. His rule was regarded as draconian, leading to internal rebellions, one of which took refuge in a tiny kingdom near Hampi called Anegundi. After attacking the kingdom, Tughlaq’s army defeated it and defeated the rebels. Tughlaq hired a general to take care of the kingdom. He returned to Delhi and left two people in charge. The unified kingdom, which controlled the entirety of South India, slowly and rapidly expanded. It was well known as the powerful Vijayanagara empire that supervised South India. As soon as the Vijayanagara empire grew, another one was also formed to its north. <br>

         Following a revolt against Muhammad bin Tughlaq, Alauddin Hassan Bahman Shah founded the first Muslim kingdom in the Deccan, the Bahmani Sultanate. It split into five Deccan Sultanates over two centuries. In the 16th century, Aliya Rama Raya, the ruler of the Vijayanagara empire, frequently clashed with the Sultanates due to his changing loyalties. The Sultanates eventually allied with him and invaded the kingdom. The Deccan sultanates defeated Aliya Rama Raya in the iconic Battle of Talikota, which lasted for nearly a century. The Muslim officers switched their loyalty to the sultanates and captured the surprised Raya at the last moment. They then beheaded him on the battlefield, creating chaos and confusion in the Vijayanagara army, thus losing the battle. The ruins of Hampi in India make it the immense open-air archaeological museum worldwide. The Sultanates plundered Hampi after defeating the magnificent Vijayanagara empire, but the ruins of Hampi still survive today. The question arises in your mind who built Hampi. King Devaraya II constructed it.

Integrity of Hampi: Historical and Cultural Significance  <br>
The integrity of Hampi, an ancient city located in Karnataka, India, is rooted in its vast and well-preserved remains of the Vijayanagara Empire. As a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Hampi holds significant historical, architectural, and cultural importance, showcasing the glory of one of the largest and most powerful empires in South India during the 14th to 16th centuries. <br>

Key Aspects of Hampi’s Integrity  -<br>
1. Historical Integrity
Capital of Vijayanagara Empire: Hampi served as the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire from the mid-14th century until its destruction in 1565 following the Battle of Talikota. The empire was known for its military prowess, trade, culture, and art. Hampi's ruins provide a comprehensive understanding of the empire’s political, religious, and social structure.
Preservation of Structures: The site has retained its historical urban planning, which includes temples, palaces, market streets, and fortifications. Hampi’s monuments offer insight into the architectural and technological achievements of the Vijayanagara rulers. <br>
2. Architectural Integrity 
Temples and Monuments: Hampi is renowned for its Dravidian-style architecture, with over 1,600 monuments spread over 4,100 hectares. Notable structures include:
Virupaksha Temple: One of the oldest and most important temples dedicated to Lord Shiva, still functioning as a religious site.
Vittala Temple: Known for its iconic stone chariot and musical pillars, exemplifying Vijayanagara's architectural grandeur.
Hazara Rama Temple, Lotus Mahal, Queen’s Bath, and Royal Enclosure: These structures highlight the fusion of Hindu, Islamic, and secular architectural styles.
Structural Integrity: Despite the destruction caused by the Deccan Sultanates in the 16th century, many of Hampi's architectural marvels have survived in relatively good condition. The city's layout, fortifications, water systems, and religious structures are remarkably intact, providing a vivid picture of its former glory. <br>
3. Cultural and Religious Integrity
Religious Significance: Hampi has a deep spiritual connection due to its association with Hindu mythology. The region is believed to be Kishkinda, the monkey kingdom described in the Ramayana, where Lord Rama met Hanuman. Temples dedicated to Virupaksha (Shiva) and Vittala (Vishnu) continue to attract pilgrims, ensuring the continuity of religious practices.
Cultural Practices: The living traditions of Hampi, especially in and around the Virupaksha Temple, preserve the cultural heritage of the region. Festivals like the Hampi Utsav celebrate the art, music, and dance traditions of Vijayanagara.  <br>
4. Environmental and Landscape Integrity
Natural Setting: Hampi’s landscape, with its rocky terrain, boulder-strewn hills, and the Tungabhadra River, adds to the site’s integrity. The surrounding natural features, such as Matanga Hill, Hemakuta Hill, and the Tungabhadra River, were integral to the city's defense and its spiritual identity.
Water Systems: The ancient irrigation systems in Hampi, which include canals, aqueducts, and wells, are evidence of the sophisticated water management techniques used by the Vijayanagara rulers to sustain agriculture and the city's large population. <br>
5. Archaeological Integrity
Continuous Archaeological Research: Archaeological excavations and studies continue to reveal the layers of Hampi's history, helping to restore its original layout and provide insights into the everyday lives of its citizens.
Restoration and Conservation: Efforts by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and UNESCO have helped in conserving the site’s integrity, preserving its key monuments and preventing encroachments.  <br>
6. Challenges to Integrity
Modern Developments: Despite conservation efforts, Hampi faces challenges from modern infrastructure projects, illegal constructions, and tourism pressures. Encroachments near the monuments and the expansion of the nearby town can threaten the site’s integrity if not managed carefully.
Natural Erosion: The boulder-filled landscape is also susceptible to natural erosion and weathering, which could affect the stability of the ancient structures over time.  <br> <br>

          Spiritual Significance of Hampi
          Hampi, located in Karnataka, is not only a site of immense historical and architectural importance but also holds deep spiritual significance. The ancient city is intertwined with Hindu mythology, particularly the Ramayana, and has been a center of religious devotion for centuries. Here are the key aspects of Hampi's spiritual significance: <br>
          
          1. Association with the Ramayana (Kishkinda)
          Hampi is believed to be the mythological Kishkinda, the kingdom of the monkey gods in the Ramayana, one of the two great Hindu epics. Several places in and around Hampi are associated with key events from the Ramayana:
          
          Anjaneya Hill: This hill is considered the birthplace of Hanuman, the monkey god and ardent devotee of Lord Rama. The temple atop the hill is dedicated to Hanuman and is an important pilgrimage site.

          These associations make Hampi a revered site for devotees of Lord Rama and Hanuman.  <br>
          
          2. Virupaksha Temple: Devotion to Lord Shiva
          The Virupaksha Temple is one of the oldest and most important religious structures in Hampi, and it remains an active site of worship. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, known here as Virupaksha, the temple has been a place of continuous worship since the 7th century.
          The temple complex is closely connected to the sacred Tungabhadra River, which flows alongside it. The river is considered holy, and pilgrims take ritual baths in its waters before visiting the temple.
          Virupaksha Temple is not only significant for its architectural beauty but also as a major religious center for Shaivism (devotion to Lord Shiva). Festivals like Shivaratri and the annual chariot festival attract thousands of devotees.   <br>
          3. Vittala Temple: Devotion to Lord Vishnu
          The Vittala Temple, dedicated to Lord Vishnu, is one of the most famous temples in Hampi. Vittala is a form of Vishnu worshipped in the region.

          4. Spiritual Geography: Sacred Sites and River Worship
          The Tungabhadra River, which flows through Hampi, is regarded as a holy river. Bathing in its waters is considered purifying, and the river is integral to the spiritual landscape of the area.
          Several other sacred locations, such as Matanga Hill and Hemakuta Hill, are associated with spiritual practices and meditation. These hills offer breathtaking views of Hampi and are often visited by pilgrims for reflection and prayer.   <br>
          5. Religious Festivals and Pilgrimages
          Hampi hosts several religious festivals throughout the year, the most significant being the Hampi Utsav, which celebrates the cultural and spiritual heritage of the region.
          During Shivaratri, thousands of devotees gather at the Virupaksha Temple to offer prayers to Lord Shiva. The chariot festival is another major event where the temple’s deity is taken in a procession through the streets, accompanied by music, dance, and chanting.   <br>
          6. Jain Temples: Spiritual Tolerance
          Hampi is also home to several Jain temples, reflecting the region's historical religious tolerance. These temples, such as the Hemakuta Hill Jain Temples, highlight the peaceful coexistence of various religious traditions in Hampi.  <br>
          7. Spiritual Practices in Hampi
          Many pilgrims and visitors come to Hampi for spiritual retreats and meditation due to its peaceful, sacred atmosphere. The ruins and temples provide a serene setting for contemplation, and the area's spiritual energy is palpable.

       <h3> 1. History of Sanchi   </h3>
      <p>  Hampi, located in the Karnataka state of southern India, is one of the most historically and architecturally significant ancient cities in India. It was the capital of the mighty Vijayanagara Empire, which ruled over South India from the 14th to the 16th centuries. The city is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, renowned for its temples, palaces, and monuments that showcase the grandeur of its era.

        1. Early History
        The region of Hampi has been inhabited since ancient times and is closely associated with Hindu mythology, especially the Ramayana, where it is identified with Kishkinda, the monkey kingdom ruled by Sugriva and home to Lord Hanuman.
        Before it became the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire, the area around Hampi was a site of religious significance due to the presence of the Virupaksha Temple, which is still an active place of worship today.   </p>
       <h3>  2. Vijayanagara Empire (1336–1565)</h3>
       <p>
        Hampi’s history as a major city began with the foundation of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1336 AD by Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I. The empire was established to defend southern India from Muslim invasions and to promote Hindu culture, art, and religion.
        Over the next two centuries, Hampi grew into one of the largest and most prosperous cities in the world, serving as the political, economic, and cultural capital of the empire. The city attracted traders from Europe, Persia, and Arabia.
        The rulers of Vijayanagara, especially Krishna Deva Raya (reigned 1509–1529), built grand temples, bazaars, palaces, aqueducts, and fortifications that made Hampi a center of wealth and culture.   </p>
        
       <h3>3. Architectural and Cultural Flourishing </h3>
         <p> 
          The city’s architecture reflects a blend of Hindu, Islamic, and Indo-Islamic styles, with intricate carvings and grand temple complexes like the Virupaksha Temple, Vittala Temple, and Hazara Rama Temple.
          Hampi’s markets (or bazaars) were bustling centers of trade, dealing in precious stones, spices, textiles, and more. Foreign travelers such as Niccolò de' Conti, Abdur Razzaq, and Domingo Paes described Hampi as a city of immense wealth and opulence.
    </p> 
       <h3>  4. Decline and Destruction (1565) </h3>
     <p>  
      Hampi’s fall came after the Battle of Talikota in 1565, when the combined forces of the Deccan Sultanates (Bijapur, Golconda, Ahmadnagar, and Bidar) defeated the Vijayanagara army. The city was sacked, pillaged, and left in ruins.
      After its destruction, Hampi was abandoned, and the once-great city gradually fell into obscurity.   </p>
        
        <h3>5. Rediscovery and Preservation</h3>
     
     
     <p>   
      In the 19th century, British archaeologists rediscovered Hampi, and since then, it has been the subject of extensive archaeological excavation and restoration efforts.
